# Morphological Image Processing
Simple Python script for applying basic morphological operations to images. Takes a JPEG image as input and outputs separate JPEG files for each operation (dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and object extraction). The script converts input images to binary format before processing and includes comprehensive error handling and logging. Built using OpenCV and NumPy, it requires Python 3.x and can be run from the command line with optional kernel size parameter: `python script.py input.jpg [kernel_size]`. All operations are performed independently on the original image, with results saved as separate files (e.g., `input_dilate.jpg`, `input_erode.jpg`, etc.). Developed as part of a university coursework focusing on morphological image processing techniques.
